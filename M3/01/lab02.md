## Lab 2: Use the Azure TCO Calculator (10 min)

In this Lab, you will use the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator to generate a cost comparison report for an on-premises environment.

**Note:** This Lab provides example definitions of on-premises infrastructure and workloads for a typical datacenter. To create a TCO Calculator report, use the example definitions or provide details of your actual on-premises infrastructure and workloads.

### Task 1: Configure the TCO calculator
